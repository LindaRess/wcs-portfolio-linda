      <p>
        I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age, now
        Iâ€™m 20 years old, Pursuing my Software Engineering Degree in VIT
        University Vellore. Web development is my center of interest, i always
        love the idea of cross-platform development, 1-n one code base deploy
        into almost any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables
        me to do. I also like creating Interactive UI components for better UX
        and share those desgin and codes to the world through Github, Codepen
        and Instagram.
